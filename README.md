# Deadlands Dice Roller

   A minimal web app that lets does the hard work of character and roll management, so players can focus on the game. 
   
   Want to give it a try? Visit the [staging environment](https://devserver-main--dice-roller-deadlands.netlify.app/). It's currently not built for mobile, so viewing on a computer is best. 
   
   Mess around with the functionality as much as you like. My players are using the production environment and production database.

## Motivation & Problem Statement

   I initally started building this for my wife. Our gaming group meets regularly, and my wife had put together a patchwork of custom tools to let her play -- a spreadsheet to manage her stats, random dice rollers not designed for the mechanics of this specific game, and discord to track things like experience points and fate chips. I saw how much toil she was putting in to play the game, so I decided to figure out something to make her life easier.

   Existing solutions didn't fit what she needed. They were all some combination of too heavy weight (roll20 suffers severely from feature bloat), too outdated, or too expensive. I decided I could build something better for her specific needs.
   
   After I released the MVP, the rest of the group saw what I'd built and asked to be added too. Now we're all using it, and I'm collecting feedback to inform future iterations.

## Tech Stack

   **React** - React felt like a great fit for this project. Lots of different components that need to speak to each other and rerender quickly.

   **MongoDB** - I chose MongoDB primarily because of the schema-less document model. While character sheets have similar structure, they can vary significantly on details. Some characters may know 5 languages, some may specialize in driving steam wagons. I wanted to create a system that would be friendly to players' characters as they grow and evolve.

   **Netlify** - The focus of this project was to get functionality up and running quickly. I decided to use a Netlify + MongoDB Atlas starter project to expedite configuration and spend more of my time on feature development.

## Key Features

   ### üôã Character selector view
   Because each character's stats are different, it's important make sure they're using the correct character.
   
   ![The character selector view](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garretdepass/deadlands-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/images/screenshots/character-selector.png "The character selector view")

   An earlier version of this app had a character selector that was on the top of the character sheet with the first player in the array selected by default. This caused some confusion, because players could select dice and roll them without switching to the correct character. Consequently, I pulled out the character selector to a mandatory first step with its own screen.

   Our DM (or "Marshal" in Deadlands) *loves* keeping track of stats, so this serves the added benefit of giving him the ability to see anyone's stats instantly.

   ### üìä Character Sheet
   After selecting a character, that character's stats are automatically shown. These are pulled directly from MongoDB, and persist when the page is refreshed. 

   ![The character sheet view, displaying all of this characters stats.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garretdepass/deadlands-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/images/screenshots/character-sheet.png "The character sheet view, displaying all of this characters stats.")
   
   <!-- The Character view includes:
   * Traits, attributes, and concentrations that can be rolled
   * Non-rollable traits that still affect gameplay
   * A wind tracker, which is similar to hit points in other systems. Total wind is calculated off of Spirit and Vigor. The current wind is not loaded from MongoDB, because the group resets wind at the beginning of each session.
   * Fate Chips that affect gameplay in various ways. These can be incremented or decremented, and persist on page reload. -->

   ### üé≤ Dice rolling panel
   
   This is the core functionality of this web app. A player can select any rollable stat and the correct number of dice with the correct number of sides will appear. Pressing `Roll Dice` rolls all the dice and scores according to unique Deadlands rules.

   ![Two instances of the roll panel. One with an ace and one with some score modifiers applied](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garretdepass/deadlands-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/images/screenshots/roll-panel.png "Two instances of the roll panel. One with an ace and one with some score modifiers applied")
   
   
   According to the Player handbook:

   > Trait and Aptitude rolls are open-ended. This means if you roll the maximum number on any of your dice, you can roll that die again and add the next roll to that die‚Äôs current total. The maximum number on a die is called the ‚ÄúAce.‚Äù You can keep rolling the die and adding it to the running total as long as you keep getting Aces. If you should get Aces on several of your individual dice, you need to keep track of each series of dice rolls separately. When you‚Äôre done, the series that got the highest total is the number you should give to the Marshal.

   The roll panel also accounts for common modifiers. When a player rolls a stat with zero dice, their roll result receives a -4 modifier, and if a majority of dice are 1's, the player must inform the Marshal they have "gone bust".

   ### Bounty points 

   ![Bounty points view, with upgrades ready to purchase](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/garretdepass/deadlands-dice-roller/refs/heads/main/images/screenshots/bounty-points.png "Bounty points view, with upgrades ready to purchase")
   Bounty points are similar to experience points in other systems. They can be spent to upgrade stats, and the cost depends on a number of factors. This can be complicated to figure out, and the players in our group regularly needed reminders from the Marshal, so I calculated and displayed all costs within the app. 
   
   I also created a "shopping cart" that shows the remaining bounty points and the upgrades a player wants before they confirm and spend their points. These upgrades can be added or removed, and a notification appears if players try to spend more points than they have.

## Design Decisions & Tradeoffs

   **Web-only**
   
   The players in my group all play remotely on computers over discord, so I opted for a large-screen-only design for the first iteration. In the future, I may explore design solutions that support mobile views. It could be useful to have the roller on a second smaller screen to enable the player to primarily focus on the video call. For the MVP, the use case didn't justify the effort.
   
   **Netlify + MongoDB Atlas**

   The primary focus of this project was to build react code that functioned within a working tech stack. Consequently, I biased for more pre-configured technology to support my efforts. Using Netlify and MongoDB Atlas in a starter project allowed me to get to working on core app functionality much faster than I would have been able to if I'd opted for putting together my own server and using a self-hosted instance of MongoDB.

   The biggest tradeoff here is that I very much learn by doing, so I wasn't able to experience building the full stack here. I was certainly exposed to some necessary configuration, and I got to learn about MongoDB, but I didn't get the deep understanding that comes with building the infrastructure from scratch. In a future project, I'd like to spin up my own server to really get a sense of what that part of the process is like.

   **Minimal UI design phase**

   I also deprioritized a deep dive into the UI design up front. I did enough in figma to feel like I had a strong understanding of the basic layout and functionality, but I knew that complications would reveal themselves during the build that were not apparent to me in the design phase. This path proved valid, and got me to coding faster. It also allowed me to learn more about how the logic needed to work than I could have in Figma.

   Of course, the tradeoff is that there's overall less visual polish than I'd like. Visual polish has a subconscious impact on overall perceived quality. While it's okay to deprioritize this for early product work, getting things looking sharp is important as the product matures. I've put a full design pass into my future roadmap below.

   **Passing too many states between nested components**

   Several different components are speaking to each other in this app. When I started, just the character sheet and roll panel needed to communicate, so this was a fine pattern. It was fast, simple, and added minimal complexity given the scope of the codebase at the time. However, when I added additional functionality, I found myself passing states up and down multiple layers of nested components. 
   
   While this is working, it's not the most elegant or maintainable. Before adding any additional functionality, I'd like to refactor this pattern and apply contexts to eliminate the need to pass states up and down.

<!-- ## Testing & Quality

    Optional but valuable: Describe your testing strategy, if any.

    Bonus: Link to tests, CI/CD pipeline setup, or coverage reports. -->

## What's Next
   Based on feedback from my group, my near-term roadmap includes:

   1. Fate chip functionality - these have functional impacts on rolls, and can be exchanged for Bounty Points. I'd like to make them fully functional with menus that clearly explain the way chips are used.
   1. Track equipment
   1. Track edges and hindrances. These are quirks about player characters that have impacts on gameplay. I'd like to add their modifiers to rolls. Each is unique, and will require its own logic.
   1. Upload, store, and change character images
   1. Add concentrations - useful if a character learns a new language or starts shooting with a new type of gun.
   1. Create a new character
   1. Visual polish - I'd like to take a measured visual pass and make the experience feel more refined.
   
   Beyond adding basic functionality, I also think it would be interesting to explore releasing this as a product other gaming groups can use. It feels like there's a niche in this product category that I could fill. Depending on interest, I may explore releasing another similar lightweight dice roller for other game systems with a broader player base.

## What I Learned

   This project taught me so much. 

   - Sharpened my skills with react.
   <!-- - Learned about writing tests -->
   - I've written tickets and worked from tickets, but this was my first time fully designing, PMing, and engineering a project. 
      - As an engineer, I got to feel what it's like to have acceptance criteria clearly (and sometimes not so clearly) recorded by my PM brain. I got to experience the difference between a well-constructed figma component that let me copy and paste styling, and a not-so-well built component that required me to define styles, name things, and generally figure stuff out on my own. I also got to experience being given a high-complexity story that was high enough priority that it was worth taking extra time to complete.
      - As a PM, I got to feel the impact of engineering communicating feature complexity. Do we cut scope? Do we push through and deliver the value of the feature? What do we deprioritize in order to make room for the most important things? Is there anything we can shave off of this story to make it easier to ship?
      - As a designer, I got to experiment with more of a "go fast and do less" approach than I'm used to. I've always strived to put together well-crafted deliverables with engineering in mind but, in a situation where I'm wearing all the hats, deprioritizing this felt like the right tradeoff.


## Code Highlights

   ### Spending bounty points
   When spending bounty points, in order to update a stat in the database, I needed each stat upgrade to reference a specific place in that character's JSON document. I wanted this to be a generic function that could apply regardless of whether the player is updating a Trait, an attribute (which is a child of a trait), or a concentration (which is a child of an attribute). 
   
   Within [stat_upgrade_button.js](https://github.com/garretdepass/deadlands-dice-roller/blob/main/src/components/stat_upgrade_button.js), I created a function that returns any stat's index dynamically. I then set the output of that function to a property of an object that is created for any stat the player wants to upgrade. I then added that object to an array that populates the shopping cart.
   
      const jsonStatIndex = () => {

         for (let traitCounter = 0; traitCounter < character.stats.traits.length; traitCounter ++) {
            const currentTrait = character.stats.traits[traitCounter]
            if (currentTrait.name === stat.name) {
                  return(`stats.traits.${traitCounter}`)
            } else if (currentTrait.attributes) { 
                  for (let attributeCounter = 0; attributeCounter < currentTrait.attributes.length; attributeCounter ++) {
                     const currentAttribute = currentTrait.attributes[attributeCounter]
                     if (currentAttribute.name === stat.name) {
                        return(`stats.traits.${traitCounter}.attributes.${attributeCounter}`)
                     }
                     else if (currentAttribute.concentrations && currentAttribute.name) {
                        for (let concentrationCounter = 0; concentrationCounter < currentAttribute.concentrations.length; concentrationCounter ++) {
                              const currentConcentration = currentAttribute.concentrations[concentrationCounter];
                              if (currentConcentration.name === stat.name) {
                                 return(`stats.traits.${traitCounter}.attributes.${attributeCounter}.concentrations.${concentrationCounter}`)
                              }
                        }
                     }
                  } 
            }
         }               
      }

      const popover = document.getElementById("insufficientBountPointsPopover")

      const handleAttributeOrConcentrationClick = () => {
         const cost = dieCountUpgradeCost()
         if (cost <= remainingBountyPoints) {
            const newUpgrade = {
                  cost: dieCountUpgradeCost(),
                  stat: stat,
                  statType: statType,
                  jsonStatIndex: jsonStatIndex(),
                  upgradeType: "dieCount"
            }
            setUpgradesArray([...upgradesArray, newUpgrade])
         } else {
            popover.showPopover()
         }
      }


   ### Rolling dice

   The way Deadlands handles dice rolling is rather unusual, so the code to handle it was a lot of fun to write! Within [roll_panel.js](https://github.com/garretdepass/deadlands-dice-roller/blob/main/src/components/roll_panel.js), it starts by creating an array of dice to roll based on which stat the player selects. This is used to display the pre-rolled state.

      const generateDiceArray = (dieCountToRoll, dieSidesToRoll) => {
        setHighestRollResult(null)
        setIsBust(false)
        const dice = [];
        let dieCount = dieCountToRoll;

        if (dieCount === 0) {
            dieCount = 1
            setIsUnskilled(true)
        } else {
            setIsUnskilled(false)
        }
        for (let i = 0; i < dieCount; i++ ) {
            dice.push(dieSidesToRoll);
        };
        return dice;
    }; 

   Then it defines what a rolled value is
    
    const returnRolledDieValue = (totalSides) => {return(Math.ceil(Math.random() * totalSides))}
    
   and rolls dice based on the stat selected by the player. Each roll is added to an array, with any exploding dice added to that array.

    const returnRolledDiceArray = (dieCountToRoll, dieSidesToRoll) => {
        let threadCount = 0;
        isUnskilled === true ? threadCount = 1 : threadCount = dieCountToRoll;
        const allRolledThreads = [];
        
        for (let currentThread = 0; currentThread < threadCount; currentThread++ ) {
            const newThread = [];
            const rollResult = returnRolledDieValue(dieSidesToRoll)
            newThread.push(rollResult)
            
            if (rollResult === dieSidesToRoll) {
                let isExploding = true
                while (isExploding === true) {
                    const aceRollResult = returnRolledDieValue(dieSidesToRoll)
                    newThread.push(aceRollResult)
                    if (aceRollResult !== dieSidesToRoll) {isExploding = false}
                }
            }
            allRolledThreads.push(newThread);
        };
        return allRolledThreads;
    }

   Then each array is evaluated for which one returned the highest total
    
    const findHighestThread = (array) => {
        const allThreadTotals = [];
        
        array.forEach(thread => {
            let threadTotal = 0;
            thread.forEach((value, index) => {
                threadTotal += value;
            })
            allThreadTotals.push(threadTotal)
        })
        
        const highestThread = {};
        highestThread.total = 0;
        
        allThreadTotals.forEach((value, index) => {
            if (value > highestThread.total) {
                highestThread.total = value;
                highestThread.index = index
            }
        })
        return highestThread   
    }

   And the roll is evaluated to see if the player went bust

    const checkForBust = (array) => {
        let totalDice = 0;
        let numberOfOnes = 0;
        array.forEach(thread => {
            thread.forEach(die => {
                totalDice ++;;
                if (thread[0] === 1) {numberOfOnes ++};
            })
        });
        if (numberOfOnes > Math.floor(totalDice / 2)) {
            setIsBust(true);
        } else {
            setIsBust(false);
        };
    }

   Then for each die, JSX is generated to render the die shapes

    const returnDie = (thread, isInHighThread) => {
        const die = Array.isArray(thread) ? thread.map((value, valueIndex) => (
            <Die key={generateKey()} dieSides={dieSidesToRoll} dieFace={value} isInHighThread={isInHighThread} />
        )) : <Die key={generateKey()} dieSides={dieSidesToRoll} dieFace={thread} isInHighThread={isInHighThread}/>
        return die;
    }

   and each thread is rendered in JSX, with the highest thread getting special styling.

    const renderDiceThreads = (array, newHighestThread) => {
        const jsx = Array.isArray(array) ? array.map((thread, threadIndex) => (
            newHighestThread.index === threadIndex ?

            <div key={`thread-${threadIndex}`} className="dice-section__die-thread">
                <div className="dice-section__die-thread-inner dice-section__die-thread-inner_highest">
                    {returnDie(thread, true)}
                    <div className="dice-section_highest-roll-text">Highest roll</div>    
                </div>
            </div>
            :
            <div key={`thread-${threadIndex}`} className="dice-section__die-thread">
                <div className="dice-section__die-thread-inner">
                {returnDie(thread, false)}    
                </div>
            </div>
            
        )) : <div>missing array</div>
        return jsx
    }

   Finally, it's all pulled together in `handleRollDice`.

    const handleRollDice = (dieCountToRoll, dieSidesToRoll) => {
        const threads = returnRolledDiceArray(dieCountToRoll, dieSidesToRoll)
        const newHighestThread = findHighestThread(threads)
        let adjustedTotal = newHighestThread.total
        if (isUnskilled) {adjustedTotal -= 4}
        if (adjustedTotal < 0) {adjustedTotal = 0}
        setHighestRollResult(adjustedTotal)
        checkForBust(threads)
        setDiceSection(renderDiceThreads(threads, newHighestThread))
    }
